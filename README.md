## Usage

The Resume Fine-Tuner provides a `ResumeFineTuner` class that you can use to optimize your CV sections based on a job description. Here's a simple example of how to use it:

```python
from ResumeFineTuner.ResumeFineTuner import ResumeFineTuner

# Load your CV template to data and copy and paste the job description
job_description = "The job description here."

# Initialize the ResumeFineTuner
rft = ResumeFineTuner(job_description)

# Fine-tune the CV sections
rft.fine_tune_cv()
```

The `fine_tune_cv` method of the `ResumeFineTuner` class will take your CV text and the job description as input and return an optimized version of the CV with sections tailored to the job requirements.

## Features

- **Customization**: You can customize the fine-tuning process to suit your specific needs, such as specifying which sections of the CV to optimize or adjusting the optimization parameters.

- **Language Support**: The fine-tuning model supports multiple languages, ensuring that the optimized CV reads fluently and naturally.
